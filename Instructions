Requirements:

	The following are python requirements to be installed in the environment:

		pip install psycopg2
		pip install twilio
		pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
		pip install SQLAlchemy
		pip install Flask
	
	The app runs on localhost:5000

	Postgres sql needs to be running on port 5432 and the app assumes there is a user called emotiveai with password emotiveai in a database called postgres. As long as the database 'postgres' exists with the username and password as mentioned, the app will take care of the tables (i.e. it will create them if required). 

	To actually test the project, the api that should be hit needs to be set on my twilio account. You can download ngrok and run 'ngrok http 5000'. This generates a url which I can set on my account for you to test the project!

Run the project using python app.py!
